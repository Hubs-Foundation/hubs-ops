    AllowedPattern: ^((?:([a-z0-9]\.|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9\-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])\.)+)([a-z0-9]{2,63}|(?:[a-z0-9][a-z0-9\-]{0,61}[a-z0-9]))\.?$
    ConstraintDescription: Must be a valid domain name (eg myhub.com or hub.mycompany.com)
  IsDomainOnRoute53:
    Type: String
    Description: We recommended you use Route 53 to manage your domain. Set to Yes if your domain is set up on Route 53, and you can move onto the next item. Set to No if your domain is on a third party service such as GoDaddy or Namecheap. If you choose 'No', you'll need to set the fields in 'Custom SSL Certificates' below. Also, if you choose 'No', once your stack is created you'll need to update your DNS provider using the 'AddressForRootDomain' information in the 'Outputs' tab. See the 'Outputs' tab once the stack is created for more information on what to do next.
    AllowedValues: ["Yes - My domain is set up on Route 53", "No - My domain is not on Route 53 and I will set up my SSL certificate below in the 'SSL Certificates' section"]
  ShortlinkZone:
    Type: AWS::Route53::HostedZone::Id
    Description: You'll need a Route 53 domain name for short room permalinks, entry codes, and device linking. (eg myhub.link) It should *not* be the same domain as the any of the domain names that you specified above. This domain will be used by visitors to share room links, and ideally should be short and easy to type since it will be typed by users on mobile devices and in VR.
    AllowedPattern: ".+"
    ConstraintDescription: You didn't specify a short link Route 53 Zone. Please choose one or create a new domain name on AWS on Route 53, ideally one short and easy to type.
  InternalZone:
    Type: AWS::Route53::HostedZone::Id
    Description: Your hub needs a domain name to use internally for server management. If your primary domain is on Route 53 and you're not using it for anything else, you can choose it here. Otherwise, you'll need to register a new domain name on Route 53 for this (for example, myhub-internal.com). This domain name will not be seen by users.
    AllowedPattern: ".+"
    ConstraintDescription: You didn't specify an internal Route 53 Zone. Please choose one or create a new domain name on AWS on Route 53. It can be anything you want and is used internally. It will not be seen by your visitors.
  EmailZone:
    Type: AWS::Route53::HostedZone::Id
    Description: To verify email addresses, your hub needs to be able to send email. If you do not have an existing email SMTP provider, choose a Route 53 domain you'd like to send email from. It will be set up automatically using AWS Simple Email Service. If you have an existing email provider you'd like to send email from (eg Mailchimp) or already have a verified domain in AWS Simple Email Service select the same zone you chose above for 'Internal Route 53 Zone' and you'll be able to enter the login credentials from your email provider later.
    AllowedPattern: ".+"
    ConstraintDescription: You didn't specify an Route 53 Zone to send email from. Please choose one. If you already have email set up, just choose your Internal Route 53 Zone.
  EmailSubdomain:
    Type: String
    Description: The Subdomain prefix to use for outgoing emails. For example, if your Outgoing Email Route 53 Zone is set to myhub.com, setting this field to "mail" will send email from the domain mail.myhub.com. If you have a third party email provider (eg Mailchimp) you can ignore this field.
    Default: mail
  AdminEmailAddress:
    Type: String
    Description: Email address for your administrator account. Individuals with access to this email address will have full administrative control of your hub. Before you can log in, you will need to verify this email address - you will get a verification email from AWS after the stack is ready.
    AllowedPattern: ".+"
    ConstraintDescription: "You must enter a contact email address."
  LetsEncryptEmailAddress:
    Type: String
    Description: Your servers will use Let's Encrypt to automatically manage SSL certificates. To receive urgent email notifications regarding your certificates from Let's Encrypt, specify a contact email here. This field is optional. By deploying this stack you agree to the LetsEncrypt TOS. (https://letsencrypt.org/repository/)
    Default: None
  UnmanagedDomainCertArn:
    Type: String
    Description: "You can skip this if your domain is on Route 53 and you chose 'Yes' above to 'Is your domain set up on Route 53?'. Otherwise, if you chose 'No' and you are using a domain name managed by another provider like GoDaddy or Namecheap you will need to create an SSL certificate in the same region as your stack in AWS Certificate Manager before completing this form. Instructions can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html. *Note* - make sure you create your SSL certificate in the AWS region you'd like to use for your hub's stack. (The region can be found in the top right corner of the AWS console.) Once you've created the certificate, paste the ARN for the certificate here (eg arn:aws:acm:<region>:<account>:certificate/<id>). You can find the ARN by clicking on the certificate in the AWS Certificate Manager console."
    ConstraintDescription: You must point to an ARN in AWS Certificate Manager for your domain.
  UnmanagedDomainEastCertArn:
    Type: String
    Description: "You can skip this if your domain is on Route 53 and you chose 'Yes' above to 'Is your domain set up on Route 53?'. Otherwise, you'll need to create a SSL certificate for your external domain in US-East-1 (N. Virginia). Instructions can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html. *Note* - make sure you provide a SSL certificate in US-East-1 regardless of what region you are creating the stack in. If you are creating your stack in US-East-1 (N. Virginia) and so already pasted a certificate ARN in US-East-1 for the above field, you can paste the same certificate ARN here. Otherwise, you'll need to create a new SSL certificate in US-East-1 and paste its ARN here. (eg arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:<account>:certificate/<id>) Be sure to change the region in the top right of the console to 'US East (N. Virginia) before creating the certificate."

      - c5.24xlarge
  StreamInstanceCount:
    Type: Number
    Description: The number of dedicated voice/video streaming server(s) you'd like to run. These servers are optional - enter a zero here if you do not want to run any streaming servers. Adding streaming servers will take network and CPU load off of your app servers. These servers will transmit voice and streaming video data between users.
    Default: 0
    MinValue: 0

    Default: 0
  AppPlacementGroupStrategy:
    Type: String
    Description: "Placement group strategy for app servers. If you only have one app server, this setting has no effect. If you have more than one app server, choose 'cluster' to increase connectivity between servers at the cost of reliability. When using 'cluster', you will have lower latency between users but your service will go down if there is an AZ-wide outage. Choose 'spread' if you would like to ensure higher availability at the cost of latency or maximum throughput between app servers. Choose 'none' if you do not have a preference, will be running more than 7 app servers, or if AWS has been failing to provision servers for you in previous attempts to create the stack. App servers communicate with one another extensively, so 'cluster' is the preferred setting if you can tolerate some risk of downtime if there are AZ-wide outages, which are rare."
    Default: cluster
    AllowedValues:
      - cluster
      - spread
      - none

  DbMaxCapacity:
    Type: Number
    Description: "Maximum ACU Capacity for the database. If you are unsure, leave this at the default. The database will be a serverless Aurora PostgreSQL-compatible cluster. Increasing the Maximum ACUs will increase the available resources to your hub for database queries, but will cost more. This needs to be set to at least 2. Pricing info for ACUs can be found at https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/"
    MinValue: 2
    MaxValue: 384
    Default: 2
  RestoreDbSnapshotIdentifier:
    Type: String
    Description: "Leave blank if you are not restoring from a backup. To restore from an existing backup, specify the AWS Aurora database snapshot identifier to restore from.

  RestoreAppDbSecretArn:
    Type: String
    Description: "Leave blank if you are not restoring from a backup. To restore from an existing backup, specify the ARN for the database secret from the hub being restored from. (eg arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account-id>:secret:AppDbSecret-xxxxxxxxx) WARNING: do *not* change or blank out this value after your stack is created, otherwise you will replace your existing database!"
  RestoreStackName:
    Type: String
    Description: "Leave blank if you are not restoring from a backup. To restore from an existing backup, specify the stack name being restored from. To restore, the secrets stored in Parameter Store must still be available from the stack being restored from.

  LoadBalancingMethod:
    Type: String
    Description: Method for load balancing requests to app servers. If you only have one or a few app servers, and would like to save on AWS costs, choose DNS Round Robin. If you have several app servers or would like improved load balancing, you can also use an Application Load Balancer, which will incur additional costs. If you are using a domain not on Route 53, be sure to note the "AddressForRootDomain" in the Outputs tab after the stack update to set your DNS to point to the ALB.
    Default: "Application Load Balancer"
    AllowedValues: ["DNS Round Robin", "Application Load Balancer"]
  AutoPauseDb:
    Type: String
    Description: Your hub uses the Aurora Serverless database, which can greatly save costs by pausing the database when your hub is not in use. However, when the database is paused, it can take up to 20 seconds for your site to come back up when you visit it. You can turn off database pausing if you'd like to avoid any delay in loading your site. Turning off pausing will incur continuous hourly database costs. Pricing info can be found at https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/
    Default: "No - Pay for database continuously to prevent loading delays"
    AllowedValues: ["Yes - Pause database when not in use", "No - Pay for database continuously to prevent loading delays"]
  StackOffline:
    Type: String
    Description: To save costs, you can switch your stack from being Online to Offline when it is not needed. This will shut down the servers while keeping all of your data. Once your stack is switched back to Online, it will come back up just how you left it.
    AllowedValues: ["Online", "Offline - Temporarily shut off servers"]
    Default: "Online"
  StackOfflineRedirectUrl:
    Type: String
    Description: (Optional) When your stack is set to Offline, visitors will be redirected to this URL.
  DatabaseMonthlyBudget:
    Type: Number
    Description: If you do not want a monthly database budget, set this to zero. To save costs, your AWS Aurora Serverless database will be shut down when nobody is hitting your site. When visitors are using your site, you'll incur database costs. To avoid unexpected charges, you can set a monthly budget. If you are running multiple hubs, this budget should reflect your maximum allowed cost across *all* your hubs in this region. This hub will automatically switch into Offline mode if the Aurora Serverless database charges across all your hubs in this region exceed this budget. A minimum $20 budget is recommended and will provide more than 40 hours a week of connectivity for a hub. You only pay for what you use. Leave this field blank to fall back to your "Max database capacity" setting in "Database Configuration" to limit your database cost. Pricing info can be found at https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/
    Default: 0
  MaxStorage:
    Type: Number
    Description: When users upload scenes, avatars, or files, they will use disk storage. You only pay for the storage you use. You can set a maximum storage amount here (in GB) to ensure there are no unexpected charges. Pricing info can be found at https://aws.amazon.com/efs/pricing/

    Description: You can restrict which IP addresses can access your site. To allow anyone on the Internet to load your site, choose 'Allow anyone to access my site.'
    AllowedValues: ["Allow anyone to access my site", "I will specify the 'Inbound Site Access CDIR' in 'Advanced' below to restrict IP addresses to my site"]
    Default: "Allow anyone to access my site"
  SpecifyInboundSSHCidr:
    Type: String
    Description: You can restrict the IP addresses that can access your servers over SSH. SSH access will always require the SSH private key file specified above and the 2FA token regardless of IP.
    AllowedValues: ["Allow anyone with the SSH secret key and 2FA token to access my servers", "I will specify the 'Inbound SSH CDIR' in 'Advanced' below to restrict SSH IP addresses to my servers"]
